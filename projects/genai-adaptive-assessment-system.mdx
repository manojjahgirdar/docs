## About

I, [Surya Deep Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surya-deep-singh-b9b94813a/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BFOGe%2FEmbTO2377SlgufPkQ%3D%3D) and [Suyash Gupte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suyash-gupte-16910917b/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BFOGe%2FEmbTO2377SlgufPkQ%3D%3D) — had an amazing 30-hour sprint at the AI Hackathon with Meta Llama, building a solution under the theme "AI for Societal Good" using Meta’s Llama foundation models.

## Overview

In the rapidly evolving EdTech landscape, educators face challenges in creating high-quality assessments at scale, while students often receive generic, one-size-fits-all evaluations that fail to adapt to their individual learning needs. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automate question generation, personalize assessments in real-time, and deliver actionable feedback — all while reducing the burden on teachers and enhancing student engagement and outcomes.

## Solution

We developed a Generative AI-powered Adaptive Assessment System aimed at transforming the EdTech space by:

- **Automating Question Generation**: Helping teachers save time with AI-generated questions.

- **Adaptive Learning Engine**: Dynamically adjusting question difficulty in real-time based on each student's performance.

- **Personalized Feedback**: Offering students instant, tailored feedback to accelerate learning.

Our system supports teachers and empowers students, showcasing the potential of GenAI in delivering equitable and scalable education.
