    ## Overview

    This hobby project is a self-driven initiative to build a collision detecting robotic car using an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, and motor driver system. The car is programmed to automatically stop when an object is detected within a set rangeâ€”demonstrating core robotics concepts like obstacle detection, motion control, and sensor integration.

    ## Architecture

    ![architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manojjahgirdar/collision-detecting-car/2d2feea013813b48f71c5a9b82d4fa7904d2e4cc/doc/src/images/architecture.png)


    ## Solution

    - The Collision Detecting Car addresses this problem by integrating:
    - An **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect obstacles.
    - A **gear motor setup** for better traction.
    - An **Arduino Uno** that acts as the brain of the system.
    - A **4x4 motor driver** powered by a 9V battery to control motion.
    - The car continuously monitors the distance to objects in front. When an object is detected within **7 inches**, it stops to avoid impact.
