## Overview

Equipped IoT to a bin and turned it into a smart bin capable of managing the waste smartly.

## Solution

The solution was a simple yet sophesticated approach to enhance waste management in the city. The smart dustbin was equipped with IoT sensors such as ESP8266 the brain, ultrasonic sensor to measure depth of the bin, servo motor to lift and close the bin and PIR sensor to detect movement infront of the bin.
- When a person approached the dustbin, the PIR sensor detected it and sent a signal to ESP8266.
- The servo motor was then sent a signal to rotate 180 degrees to lift the lid of the bin.
- The person would then dump the garbage and walk away the lid would close.
- The ultrasonic sensor within the bin measured the level of waste that was getting accmulated. Once a set treshold was reached it was send a signal to ESP8266.
- The events were tracked in Google Firebase. And an SMS and email was sent to the authority with location of the Bin that was full.
- The authority could then send their vehicle to empty the dustbin.
