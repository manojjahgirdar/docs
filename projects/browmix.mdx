## About Browmix

Browmix is a lightweight, 3-tire web application designed to simplify and streamline the management of reel inventory in corrugation and packaging operations. Unlike traditional ERP systems or complicated Excel-based tracking methods, Browmix offers a page-based, user-friendly interface that helps users inward reels, track their consumption, manage stock, and analyze raw material (RM) inventory—all with utter simplicity.

## Overview

Managing reel inventory is an operational backbone for many manufacturing and packaging businesses. Yet, the existing tools—ranging from complex ERP systems to static spreadsheets—fall short in terms of usability, accuracy, and speed. Browmix offers a focused, simple, and effective solution purpose-built to align with day-to-day shop-floor realities, rather than complicating them.

## Solution

Browmix streamlines reel inventory operations through six key capabilities:

- **Simplicity of Use:** Designed with real-world users in mind, Browmix removes unnecessary clutter and uses corrugation-specific terminology to make operations intuitive.

- **Easy Reel Inwarding:** The inwards page closely resembles mill packing slips, ensuring a smooth and familiar data entry experience.

- **Transparent Consumption Tracking:** Know where a reel was consumed, how much was used, and its value—all in a single dropdown view.

- **Clear View of Available Stock:** A consolidated stock page allows for quick filtering and decision-making based on quality, deckle, and other parameters.

- **Accurate Consumption Recording:** Users can enter reel weights post-consumption, generating a reliable, traceable consumption history.

- **Smarter Ordering:** Avoid overstocking or stock-outs by leveraging inventory analytics to forecast and optimize purchasing.
