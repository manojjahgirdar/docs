## About

This code pattern integrates a virtual mirror into an e-commerce mobile application using IBM technologies. It provides users with personalized jewellery recommendations based on their age and gender and enables them to try on products virtually using their mobile camera.


## Overview

The code pattern develops a hybrid mobile app using IBM Mobile Foundation, a recommendation engine, and a virtual mirror module. It leverages IBM Cloud services like Cloud Object Storage, Db2 on Cloud, and Cloud Foundry to build a seamless end-to-end experience for users to receive personalized product suggestions and try them in real-time.
