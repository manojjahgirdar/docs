Out of 57,000+ developer and 9,100+ idea submissions, our team got shortlisted for Google Cloud Agentic Al Day 2025, powered by Hack2skill. We built a multi-agent system with Google ADK on the use case Improving safety at large public events in a 30-hour in-person Al sprint.

We presents **Drishti**, an AI-driven situational awareness and enforcement platform aimed at enhancing public safety at large-scale events in India. The system transforms passive video surveillance into active safety management by combining real-time video analytics, predictive AI, and digital accountability.

## Overview

Drishti tackles the unique safety challenges of high-density public gatherings like rallies, festivals, and marathons in India. Instead of relying solely on human supervision, it implements a closed-loop model of real-time detection, automated intervention, and behavioral enforcement. By integrating technologies such as Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Gemini, and digital ID systems, the platform becomes a self-regulating mechanism for crowd safety and order.

## Architecture

## Solution

The solution is structured around five core components:
1.	**Predictive Analytics:** Real-time crowd congestion prediction using video feeds and AI forecasting.
2.	**AI-Powered Dispatch:** Automated emergency response leveraging GPS and live congestion data.
3.	**Digital Accountability:** Tracking attendee behavior via digital IDs (QR codes, phone numbers, Aadhaar), and issuing nudges or post-event penalties.
4.	**Scalable Multi-Agent System:** Modular agents (Predictive Agent, Dispatch Agent, Lost & Found Agent, etc.) working independently in parallel.
5.	**Cultural Adaptation:** Designed for India’s event complexity—low compliance, high density, digital familiarity.

Key Features:
- Natural language querying for field commanders.
- Context-aware summaries and predictions with Gemini.
- Lost & Found via facial recognition and drone assistance.
- Real-time rule enforcement via mobile-linked identities.
