## Overview

Based on my expertise and experience with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from past few years, I have created a GitHub repo with different Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) implementations to share my learnings.

The repo consists of the following RAG techniques:

| RAG Technique                      | Simple Definition                                                                 | When to Use                                                                           
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple RAG                         | Retrieves relevant documents based on the query and uses them to generate an answer| Basic question-answering tasks where context is needed                                |
| Simple RAG with Memory             | Extends Simple RAG by maintaining context from previous interactions               | Conversational AI where continuity between queries is important                       |
| Branched RAG                       | Performs multiple retrieval steps, refining the search based on intermediate results| Complex queries requiring multi-step reasoning or information synthesis              |
| HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) | Generates a hypothetical ideal document before retrieval to improve search relevance| When dealing with queries that might not have exact matches in the knowledge base |
| Adaptive RAG                       | Dynamically adjusts retrieval and generation strategies based on the query type or difficulty| Varied query types or when dealing with a diverse knowledge base             |
| Corrective RAG (CRAG)              | Iteratively refines generated responses by fact-checking against retrieved information| High-stakes scenarios requiring increased accuracy and fact verification            |
| Self-RAG                           | The model critiques and improves its own responses using self-reflection and retrieval| Tasks requiring high accuracy and when there's time for multiple refinement steps   |
| Agentic RAG                        | Combines RAG with agentic behavior, allowing for more complex, multi-step problem-solving| Complex tasks requiring planning, decision-making, and external tool use         |
