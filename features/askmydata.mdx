The "Ask My Data" enables users to easily upload structured Excel sheets (**currently supporting only one worksheet .csv and .xlsx with < 6MB size**), and automatically generates insightful visualizations and analyses through intuitive, conversational queries.

<Tip>
The chat with documents on watsonx.ai Prompt Lab supports only unstructured data (.docs, .pdf, etc). Therefore, we developed the "Ask My Data" specifically for visualizing structured data (.csv, .xlsx).

## Try Ask my Data with the sample data
<Steps>
    <Step title="First Step">
        <Card title="Download Excel Worksheet" icon="link" href="https://github.ibm.com/ecosystem-engineering-lab/opex-apis/raw/main/content/Service%20History.xlsx">
        Download the excel worksheet containing a car service history data.
        </Card>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Second Step">
        Click on **Upload**, and wait for couple of seconds till the file is uploaded and processed.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Third Step">
        You can choose to see **Text** outputs or **Graphs**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Fourth Step">
        You can ask the following questions:
        
        **Mathematical**:
        - What is the average "Fuel Efficiency"
        - What is the ratio of "Total Harsh Acceleration Count" to "Total Harsh Braking Count" over the months?
        - total sum of the "Total Harsh Accelaration Count"
        
        **Graph related**:
        - Create a line chart to show how the "Driving Score" changes over the months
        - Create a scatter plot or a line graph to compare "Total Distance (Km)" and "Total Clutch Count"
    </Step>
</Steps>

 <Warning>
    **Note**: This is the current workflow for ask my data:
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
    start --> agent
    agent --> tools
    tools --> end
    ```
    Hence you will see the results straight forward. We are planning to enhance the flow something like this to get a better natural language output:
     
    ```mermaid
    stateDiagram-v2
    start --> agent
    agent --> tools
    tools --> agent
    agent --> end
    ```
